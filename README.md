# Tweet-Disaster-Classification-with-BERT-and-Logistic-Regression
Tweet Disaster Classification with BERT and Logistic Regression.

## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of a tweet disaster classification system that leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Logistic Regression to classify tweets into disaster-related and non-disaster-related categories. The dataset is sourced from a Kaggle competition with as initiative aims to harness the potential of Natural Language Processing in emergency management and response. You can access the competition through the following link:  [Kaggle competition Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview).

## Models

## Dataset

The dataset consists of tweets labeled as disaster-related or not. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify these tweets, which can be an invaluable tool for disaster relief organizations and news agencies.

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with labels.
- `test.csv`: Contains the testing data without labels.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for BERT)
